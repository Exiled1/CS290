        <p class="ParagraphContent">Well, here's a little bit of information about me.</p>
        <p class="ParagraphContent">
            I'm in the 2023 OSU class as a Computer Science major, with a focus on Cyber Security.
            <br> hopefully soon I'll have a minor in Japanese as well, since I absolutely love everything Japanese.

        <h2>First Post On The Index!</h2>
        <p class="ParagraphContent">So, I'm being asked a couple of questions here so I guess I'll answer them: :)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Well, I don't know about complicated, but I made a the landing page of a programming
                    <br> workshop that I was a part of, which was rather fun.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <p class="ListContent">What do I hope to learn from this class?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Well, I'd like to learn about some database management, and also I'd like to learn some new JavaScript which would be quite nice to make a web application that I've always wanted to make.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Have I signed up for Piazza?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yep! I have indeed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>What's an intersting fact about myself?</p>
                    </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I like to make pixel art, and also I really enjoy game development and Cyber security. :^)
