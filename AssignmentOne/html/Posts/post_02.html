                <strong>So</strong>, this specific assignment was something else, I'll tell you what. Not necessarily because it was ridiculously hard, but just because it was insanely tedious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a couple issues with getting the html we were given to look as close to the mocks as possible.
                <br> My first main issue was getting the gods forsaken <strong>INLINE</strong> to work. If you don't entirely know what Inline is, don't worry, because I don't know either haha.
                <h3> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</h3>
            </p>
            <p>Jokes aside, inline alignment caused me a lot of issues, as I originally attempted to use it, but quickly ended up having a ridiculous amount of formatting/inheritance problems and I eventually just quit trying to make it work altogether.</p>
            <p>
                What did I use you might ask? Well, I used the <strong>STRICT</strong> upgrade to stupid inline alignment, and that is FLEEEEX BOX. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah boi, that's right, instead of trying to assign an inline-block for every single child that I wanted to align, all I had to do was make my align-items and justify-content to completely fix everything I needed, AND make it responsive. What did inline-block
                do for me? Absolutely nothin, NADA, zilch.
            </p>
            <p>
                I did learn a couple things from this assignment, and that's that I can use the * character as a wildcard selector to pretty much reset everything, or I could use it to set a global font, which was pretty nice. Also, I learned that inline-block is a straight
                downgrade to flex-boxes, since I don't have to worry about the children
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, a FANTASTIC resource that was insanely important towards me finishing this assignment after procrastinating for so long was<strong>W3Schools!!</strong> Without W3Schools I would have been absolutely rekt by a lack of decent tutorials
                on specific things like lists and text-boxes, etc. Also, the community Discord was a huge help to me, since all the students came together to help each other understand the small mistakes that occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, Google was my friend for this assignment. Specifically I had to look up a lot of stuff on spacing, and the aside tag in HTML. I also had to look up things like how the heck to get rid of small spaces between the header and the content, or the header
                and the top of the website, which just so happens to be because headers apparently have a <strong>FRICKIN</strong> built in margin/padding. Sooo, I ended up having to override the default spacing that comes with a variety
                of different tags, which just so happened to be things like the header, h1>h6 tags, and a couple others that I never even knew had their own default spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something else I had to eventually look up was actually how to set a maximum height/width of image elements. Also, how to make default CSS styles for input fields, because I'm really really lazy.
