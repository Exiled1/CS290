        <h2>Assignment Five Post!</h2>
        <h3 class="underlined-text">Alright, I got some things to say about Handlebars...</h3>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Let me start this off by saying that I do not enjoy Handlebars at all. Not because it's a bad templating tool, quite the opposite actually, it provides a good method of dynamically generating content. No, my issue with it is just how
            frustrating the supposedly "helpful" features it contains are, specifically with its helpers.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Handlebars helpers like the<strong class="orange-text">{{#if}} and {{#unless}}</strong>blocks are supposed to provide a way for you to conditionally render a formatting block. Conditional rendering sounds like a wonderful
            feature to have if I want to just use one view and add things to it depending on the parameters I pass in, there's only one small issue...<strong>THE DAMN THINGS AREN'T INTUITIVE TO WORK WITH.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;First off, if I want to use the conditional helpers I'd expect them to be able to evaluate a true or false condition, then generate the content based on whether or not the condition failed or not. It doesn't have to be anything complicated,
            just let me use an == to be able to decide whether or not the content should render. I would like to be able to decide if something doesn't exist, then execute the block, and that makes sense and it rather intuitive. Handlebars never really
            got the memo though, since the<strong class="orange-text">{{#if}}</strong>is actually not even a real conditional, it doesn't check if something exists before it executes, no sir. If a Handlebars<strong class="orange-text">{{#if [variable]}}</strong>helper
            doesn't detect a variable there in the first place, it just refuses to render the content altogether. Which leads me to my second issue with HB.
        </p>
        <h3 class="underlined-text">IT'S SO ANNOYING TO DEBUG</h3>
        <blockquote class="fancy-blockquote">"Oh but there's not really that many things that you have to even worry about with Handlebars, what would you have to debug about it?" -- Some random nerd
        </blockquote>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;See, this is why web development makes me seem violent to random bystanders. You would<i>technically</i>be right saying that HB doesn't really have too many features to worry about. It is a very lightweight framework after
            all, however, one very important thing to consider about it is that Handlebars<b>Doesn't. Throw. Non. Critical. Errors.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If I make a typo in a helper variable, I don't want to have to spend hours chasing every possible documented error known to the framework. Only to find out that I wasn't dealing with an end of days bug, but a typo I'd made many
            hours ago. Okay, so Handlebars has this really annoying feature with its<strong class="orange-text">{{#if}}</strong>blocks; if the variable doesn't exist, or fits a bunch of other empty condition criteria, Handlebars goes ahead and doesn't
            bother rendering your content. So, in cases where I've made a typo between post and posts, but correctly pass in what I believe to be the helper variable, my console won't even bother telling me jack diddly about missing variables, or anything
            like that. On top of that, since HB has nothing to do with the javascript once it's rendered, I can't even use the console to check whether or not the conditon is even being fulfiled or not.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            <i>&emsp;&emsp; Le sigh</i>Anyways, I complain but after I got used to Handlebars' workflow it was actually pretty nice to work with and let me focus on creating the content versus having to worry about how I wanted to reuse HTML that i'd
            written before. In the end I'd probably rate it a solid<b>7.1 ducks out of 10.</b>A respectable score.
