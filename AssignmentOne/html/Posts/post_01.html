                    So this is my first blog post! And I guess I just wanted to add a little bit of content to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, this assignment was really easy, since it's just been writing some HTML, which I'm pretty used to doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only challenge I had was just finding the time to type everything. After cementing my workflow I should be able to find more time to work on the site, as well as do some other projects other than programming related ones. :^)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I already knew everything I'd need to make a basic website, so writing and structuring some HTML was a pretty fun experience. :^D
                </p>

                    W3 Has pretty much everything that you'd ever want to have in order to make a website, however it's only a reference guide with examples.

                <p>The way I use this service is pretty much as a refresher for material I already know, and for skills I don't already know the website has really amazing lessons and a dynamic window where you can see the changes you make to a virtualized
                    website that you make on the site.</p>
