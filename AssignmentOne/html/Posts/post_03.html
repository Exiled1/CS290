        <h2>Assignment Three Post!</h2>
        <h3 class="underlined-text">Let's talk about some JavaScript:</h3>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I would like to point out that I don't inherently hate JavaScript, however, I will say that it's frustrating with how many things it takes from me in terms of control. During Assignment Three I found that I was having more trouble trying
            to select the exact elements that I wanted to manipulate than I did coming up with the logic behind the filter.
        </p>

        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One of the more frustrating things about writing filter code is that I never entirely understood what I was trying to do, and I just ended up coding blindly while trying to force the language to do what I wanted it to do. Blindly coding
            was slightly frustrating since I eventually realized that there was most likey a much easier way to do what I wanted to do that I just couldn't wrap my head around. Small plateaus continued to happen through actually writing the code as I
            searched up tips and tricks on the internet to do what I wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While I actually did find small tricks I could use to help me achieve what I wanted to do I eventually realized that I could just use a QuerySelector to select the parents of the content I wanted to change. Now, this sounds like I should
            have been excited right? Well... Not really.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;See, selecting things like interior posts wasn't actually a problem. Finding their children on the other hand, THAT was an issue I was quite frustrated by. Since I wasn't able to add Tags or dynamic ID's to the elements I created with
            my CreatePost() function, I had to come up with long code statements that I had to debug constantly on the Dev Console. This wouldn't have been such an issue if it weren't for the fact that code scoping exists, and I didn't know how to make
            something global when I'm specifically in the developer console so I ended up having to write out 12+ word statements to simply select a child inside of a post just to get the content/value of it. Also, the way that JavaScript deals with equality
            is really annoying since it tries to actively change the type of whatever you're trying to check to see if they're equal in some way. This led me to much frustration.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Anyways, my overall takeaway from JavaScript is that selecting things without JQuery is incredibly frustrating. Also, not being able to add ID's and Classes for things that I believe should have them is INCREDIBLY frustrating. Also,
            I now understand why things like JSX and JQuery exist, because without them, selecting elements with no tags or classes or creating new HTML from scratch can become an incredible pain in the neck.
        </p>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the end I actually did have a lot of fun though, so it wasn't all terrible! However, I do still hope that I can try and get full credit for everything, either way it was a fun experience.
